        OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research organization founded in December 2015, researching artificial
        intelligence with the goal of developing "safe and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines
        as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work." As one of the leading
        organizations of the AI boom, it has developed several large language models, advanced image generation models,
        and previously, released open-source models. Its release of ChatGPT has been credited with starting the AI boom.
